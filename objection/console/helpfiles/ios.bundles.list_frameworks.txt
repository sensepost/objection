Command: ios bundles list_frameworks

Usage: ios bundles list_frameworks (optional: --include-apple-frameworks) (optional: --full-path)

Returns all of the application's bundles that represent frameworks. Only 
frameworks with one or more Objective-C classes in them are included. [1]

Output includes the frameworks executable, bundle name and version. The path
value is truncated by default, however, adding the --full-path flag would
print the entire path to the framework.

The --include-apple-frameworks flag signals the command to also output
bundles that form part of the com.apple package namespace. By default this
is hidden and only external frameworks not in the com.apple namespace is
retured.
