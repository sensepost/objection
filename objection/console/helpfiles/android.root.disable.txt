Command: android root disable

Usage: android root disable

Attempts to disable root detection on Android devices. This is achieved by
hooking numerous classes such as java.lang.String (for contains()),
java.lang.Runtime (for exec()) and java.io.File (for exists()). These hooked
methods have their properties or arguments inspected to determine if artefacts
commonly checked for in root detection is used, and manipulated.

If this method does not effectively disable root detection for you, keep in
mind that it us very common for applications to have helper methods such as
isRooted() that perform a number of checks in one class method. Using the
boolean return module on one of these utility methods may achieve a similar
effect.

Examples:
   android root disable
