Command: android hooking watch class_method

Usage: android hooking watch class_method <fully qualified class method>
       (optional: --dump-args) (optional: --dump-backtrace)
       (optional: --dump-return)

Hooks a specified class method and reports on invocations, together with
the number of arguments that method was called with. This command will
also hook all of the methods available overloads.
If the --include-backtrace flag is provided, a full stack trace that
lead to the methods invocation will also be dumped. This would aid in
discovering who called the original method.

Examples:
   android hooking watch class_method com.example.test.login
   android hooking watch class_method com.example.test.helper.executeQuery
   android hooking watch class_method com.example.test.helper.executeQuery --dump-backtrace
   android hooking watch class_method com.example.test.login --dump-args --dump-return
